# Function Reference

A concise index of the library functions with one purpose line each. It is grouped by topic so you can find what you need quickly: setup, windows, images, drawing, events, and the main loop. Each entry links back to usage notes and a short example in the other docs. Use this page when you remember the function name but need the exact meaning of its parameters or the order of calls.
