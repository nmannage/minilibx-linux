# Set Up, Build, and Link

Start here to get a working build. You will install the required system packages, build the library with make, and compile a tiny program that opens a window. We explain the include path, the link flags, and why each flag is needed. You will also learn a quick way to verify your environment and how to fix the most common build errors. After this, you can compile examples and move on to drawing.
